# Introduction

This program is created to supply a user with the ability to quickly create distance matrices of allelic profiles through the use of parallel processing. The program prints pairwise distances in a "molten" or flat format where distances are labeled as "sample1 sample2 distance". But a utility to quickly convert this molten format to a distance matrix is built into `go-cluster`. Created distance matrices can be used to cluster the data and output dendrograms. Querying a reference set of profiles against a larger set of profiles in parallel is supported as well.

# Install

No install is currently provided, the program must be compiled using either the `go` toolchain or `gogcc` compiler. This program of go was built using version 1.1.8 as listed in the `go.mod` file. Required dependencies are listed in the `go.mod` file, however their installation is controlled by the `go` toolchain. Instructions for installing `go` can be found here [go](https://go.dev/doc/install), Go can also likely be installed through other packaging programs like conda.

If you have `go` installed, you can simply run `go build` in the source directory and a binary file called `go-cluster` will be generated.

### Compatibility

`go-cluster` has only been tested on linux.

## Data Input

### File format for calculating pairwise-distances

The input file is a table with the first column containing a given samples name. While the subsequent columns are the names of the input loci. The program normalizes allele input first, so the actual content of the cells can vary and can be, integers, hashes or even nucleotides themselves (this would make the program run slower however). CSV files can be used, however you will have to specify the the delimiter to the command line arguments

|Sample|Loci_1|Loci_2|Loci_3|
|------|------|------|------|
|Sample1|Loci_x|5|1|
|Sample2|1|xxxxxxxxxxxx|1|
|Sample3|2|3|1|

### File format for creating a distance matrix

The pairwise distances output from the `distances` option is the input to the `distances` command. But if you are curious the output looks something like:

```
sample1 sample2 distance
sample1 sample3 distance
...
```

the output is a distance symmetric distance matrix.

### Clustering

The input is a symmetric distance matrix e.g.

```
    1   2   3
1   0  40  40
2   40  0   40
3   40  40  0
```

and the output is a newick file.

### Fast matching

The input for fast matching is two allelic profiles similar to what is passed when creating a distance matrix. There are some checks in the program to verify that you have the same number of columns but it is **IMPORTANT** That your alleles are in the same order for both of the compared profiles.

# Troubleshooting and FAQs

This program utilizes `go routines` for parallel processing which allows for more threads than logical CPUs. Currently you cannot set the maximum number of CPUs to use in this program as `go routines` will be distributed across CPUs at run time. This can be an issue on grid executors like `slurm` and it is best to run this program on an entire node of a cluster at a time.

# Other information

This program is still in development however basic end-to-end tests have been added. More code examples, benchmarks and unit-tests are still to be added. A lot of further optimizations can still be made to this program as well.
